        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My significant other and I live in a suburb outside of Stockholm with our two cats, Lilith and Lucifer. I went to school for Photo & Video, but focused more on the technical aspect rather than the art. After working in IT for five years I decided to go back to school to learn coding and change my career.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since then, I have been working on various projects to hone my skills and gain experience in the field. I have developed a keen interest in backend development and have been exploring different frameworks and databases. I am proficient in Java, SQL, Docker, Linux, and other technologies that are used in development. I am also familiar with HTTP, CSS, and JavaScript and the basics of the web. 
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, I have also been studying AWS and have earned the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certificate. This certification has helped me develop a foundational knowledge of AWS Cloud and its basic architectural principles.
