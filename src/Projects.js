        <p>I'm currently doing my internship at a smaller startup that aims to bring more education to developing countries.
        <br />
        <br />
        During my studies, I developed a Java-based backend with a REST API for a Vue.js frontend webshop. The backend was designed to handle requests from the frontend and interact with a Postgres database to track orders and quantity.

        <br />
        I aspire to contribute to open source projects that I use once I have gained sufficient proficiency in coding.
